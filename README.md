### macOS Security Warning

When you first open VAUL on macOS, you may see a warning: *"Apple could not verify vaul-v1 is free of malware"*. This is normal for unsigned applications.

**To open VAUL:**

1. **Right-click** (or Control-click) on `vaul-v1.app`
2. Select **"Open"** from the context menu
3. Click **"Open"** in the security dialog that appears

Alternatively:
1. Go to **System Settings** > **Privacy & Security**
2. Scroll down to find the blocked app message
3. Click **"Open Anyway"** next to the VAUL message

> **Note**: This warning appears because VAUL is not code-signed with an Apple Developer certificate. The app is safe to use - you can review the source code to verify. For a signed version, you would need to build it yourself or wait for an official signed release.

## 📖 Overview

**VAUL** is an open-source desktop application that helps developers store, organize, and quickly retrieve terminal commands. It functions as a personal command vault—allowing you to save frequently used or hard-to-remember CLI commands and reuse them efficiently across projects and environments.

Built for performance and simplicity, VAUL combines a Go backend with a modern React frontend using **Wails v3**, delivering a fast, native desktop experience without sacrificing developer ergonomics.

## ✨ Features

- 💾 **Persistent Storage** - Commands saved locally in your config directory
- 🎨 **Beautiful UI** - Liquid glass design with modern aesthetics
- 📋 **One-Click Copy** - Copy commands to clipboard instantly
- 🔍 **Easy Organization** - View all commands in a clean, scrollable list
- 🖥️ **Cross-Platform** - Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux
- ⚡ **Lightweight** - Native performance with minimal resource usage
- 🔄 **Real-Time Sync** - Main window and tray window stay synchronized

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Go** 1.24 or higher ([Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install))
- **Node.js** 18+ and npm ([Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/))
- **Wails CLI** v3 ([Install Wails](https://v3alpha.wails.io/quick-start/installation/))
- **Task** (optional, for using task runner) - Install via:
  ```bash
  # macOS
  brew install go-task/tap/go-task
  
  # Or using Go
  go install github.com/go-task/task/v3/cmd/task@latest
  ```

### Installation

#### From Source

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vaul.git
cd vaul/vaul-v1
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
# Install Go dependencies
go mod download

# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

3. Run in development mode:
```bash
wails3 dev
```

4. Build for production:
```bash
# Build for your current platform
wails3 build

# Or use the task runner
task build
```

### Building for Distribution

#### macOS

**Option 1: Using Task (Recommended)**
```bash
cd vaul-v1
task darwin:package
```

**Option 2: Using Wails directly**
```bash
cd vaul-v1
# Build the binary
wails3 build

# Create .app bundle manually
mkdir -p bin/vaul-v1.app/Contents/{MacOS,Resources}
cp build/darwin/icons.icns bin/vaul-v1.app/Contents/Resources/
cp bin/vaul-v1 bin/vaul-v1.app/Contents/MacOS/
cp build/darwin/Info.plist bin/vaul-v1.app/Contents/
codesign --force --deep --sign - bin/vaul-v1.app
```

**Output**: `bin/vaul-v1.app`

To create a distributable `.app` file:
1. The `.app` bundle will be created in `bin/vaul-v1.app`
2. You can zip it for distribution: `zip -r vaul-v1-macos.zip bin/vaul-v1.app`

#### Windows

**Option 1: Using Task**
```bash
cd vaul-v1
task windows:create:nsis:installer
```

**Option 2: Using Wails directly**
```bash
cd vaul-v1
# Build the executable
wails3 build

# The executable will be in: bin/vaul-v1.exe
# For installer, you'll need to use NSIS separately
```

**Output**: 
- Binary: `bin/vaul-v1.exe`
- Installer: `build/windows/nsis/vaul-v1-setup.exe` (if using Task)

**Prerequisites for Windows installer**:
- Install NSIS: `brew install makensis` (macOS) or download from [NSIS website](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/)

#### Linux

**Option 1: Using Task**
```bash
cd vaul-v1
task linux:build
```

**Option 2: Using Wails directly**
```bash
cd vaul-v1
wails3 build
```

**Output**: `bin/vaul-v1`

### Quick Build Commands

**Using Task:**
```bash
# Build for current platform
task build

# Package for current platform (creates distributable)
task package
```

**Using Wails directly:**
```bash
# Build for current platform
wails3 build

# Output will be in: bin/vaul-v1 (or bin/vaul-v1.exe on Windows)
```
